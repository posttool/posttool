                Our process builds and supports the best opportunities currently available.

                Post Tool classifies all software development projects into phases. A typical project progresses through
                each of the following phases sequentially. Often we loop through the phases continuously as needs and
                requirements grow in complexity. Our goal is to keep the software usable and logically consistent as it
                adapts to use and matures.

            <h3>Discovery </h3>
        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>One goal of discovery is to establish a succinct vocabulary that all participants can use to communicate.
               We learn your language, then refine, standardize, and document it. We then use this language to establish all the
                requirements and desires of key stakeholders.</p>

            <p>Sometimes software is developed to support an existing process and sometimes is offers something
                completely new. When software will support existing processes, an initial research project is required.
                We observe, interview and document participants as they operate &lsquo;in the field&rsquo;. Then we
                interject software where we can improve the experience. If the product represents something completely
                new, we attempt to relate it to existing processes and understand what we intend to improve. </p>

            <h3>Planning</h3>
        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>We quantify behavior in terms of activities by role and document workflows for significant
                activities. This mapping allows us to estimate resource requirements in detail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col span_2_of_5"></div>
        <div class="col span_1_of_5">
            <h3>Documentation</h3>
        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>The documentation represents an overview of the application as well as wireframes and process flows for
                identified personas.
                From the discovery and planning documents, we can implement initial wireframes. These wireframes can be
                tested with users to validate research findings. They can also be used to indicate high level components
                or visual rhetoric that will be used throughout. Once satisfied with the initial wireframe directions,
                we produce complete documentation.
                Post Tool believes that research, documentation, design and development are a unified process, so all
                team members participate in developing the documentation. This approach keeps the entire team engaged in
                what we consider the most difficult part of the process.

            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>Sometimes we have the luxury of prototyping an application before we build out the entire specification.
                This requires the team and stakeholders to identify the highest ranked features for development in the
                most efficient manner possible. This work allows us to test assumptions directly with users in front of
                a device.</p>

            <p>We facilitate user testing in many forms: online, in person, using wireframes, HTML or with a finished
                application. We establish metrics that are tracked and analyzed. This allows us to develop a roadmap for
                revision of existing features or the development of new ones.</p>

                openly discuss details in a technical way. If you are not, we will walk through the pros and cons of all

                flow of content to meet the needs of all persona. We customize and configure sophisticated content

            <p>As more daily work moves online, the need for increasingly complex web applications &ndash; either as a
                complement to existing products or software as service &ndash; becomes essential. Our UX, design and
                development teams build highly functional and custom applications to fit your needs. We believe they
                should also be engaging. Users want intuitive interfaces that allow them to drag, drop, watch and play.
                We&rsquo;ve pioneered the design and technology behind many of these paradigms.</p>
