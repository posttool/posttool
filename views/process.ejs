                <!--Our process builds on and supports the best opportunities currently available.-->
                Post Tool believes that research, documentation, design and development are a unified process in which all
                team members participate.
                Post Tool classifies all software development projects into phases. A typical project progresses through
                each of the following phases sequentially. Often we loop through the phases continuously as needs and
                requirements grow in complexity. Our goal is to keep the software usable and logically consistent as it
                adapts to use and matures.

          Platform Selection should be on the "company" page, perhaps. Seems this page should be a concise outline of process.-->

            <h3>Discovery </h3>
        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>One goal of discovery is to establish a succinct vocabulary that all participants can use to communicate.
               We learn your language, then refine, standardize, and document it. We then use this language to establish all the
                requirements and desires of key stakeholders.</p>

            <p>Sometimes software is developed to support an existing process and sometimes it offers something
                completely new. Both cases begin with an initial research process.
              <!--When software will support existing processes, an initial research project is required.-->
                We observe, interview and document participants as they operate &lsquo;in the field&rsquo;.
              If the product represents something completely
              new, we attempt to understand it in relation to existing processes, how it will fit in with and may affect
              existing practices.
              With these findings we develop software to <!--interject software where we can--> improve the experience.
              <!--and understand what we intend to improve.-->
            <!--how the new and old will coexist-->

          <p>We begin by analyzing the work into component parts in order to quantify and estimate roles and document workflows.
            We create a spreadsheet listing each signigicant part with an estimated time frame.
          <!--</p>-->
            <!--<p>We quantify behavior in terms of activities by role and document workflows for significant activities.-->
                 This mapping allows us to estimate resource requirements in detail. It also allows the client to understand
              how the work is progressing.

            <p>Post Tool has received dozens of awards for its user interface innovation throughout the &lsquo;90s.

                openly discuss details in a technical way. If you are not, we will walk through the pros and cons of all

        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>Your data ecosystem is complex. Often legacy systems must be closely intermingled with new functionality. We
                develop content strategies and processes that help you identify, prioritize, produce and control the
                flow of content to meet the needs of all personas. We customize and configure sophisticated content
                management systems capable of managing &lsquo;big data&rsquo; scale content and media.</p>

            <h3>Documentation</h3>
        </div><div class="col span_2_of_5">
            <p>The documentation is a comprehensive overview of the application. This includes wireframes and process flows for
                identified roles.</p>
            <p>Using the discovery and planning documents, we implement initial wireframes. These wireframes can be
                tested with users to validate research findings. They can also be used to indicate high level components
                or visual rhetoric that will be used throughout. Once satisfied with the initial wireframe directions,
                we produce complete documentation.

            <p>Sometimes we have the luxury of prototyping an application before we build out the entire specification.
                This requires the team and stakeholders to identify the highest ranked features for development in the
                most efficient manner possible. This work allows us to test assumptions directly with users in front of
                a device.</p>

              As more daily work moves online, the need for increasingly complex web applications &ndash; either as a
                complement to existing products or software as service &ndash; becomes essential. We believe they
                should also be engaging. Users want intuitive interfaces that allow them to drag, drop, watch and play.
                We&rsquo;ve pioneered the design and technology behind many of these paradigms.</p>
